# Using This Repo

## Extract a flat file

Open `sync_nlx` and set the variables correctly.

```
pipenv run sync_nlx.py
```

The original code compresses and pushes the flat files to S3, this version does not. It can be easily copy and pasted to add that functionality by going to the `original-code` branch.

Compress your flat file (gz preferably) and send it whereever you need to.

If instead you want to create the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) files continue to the next step without compressing.

## Conversion to [schema.org](https://schema.org/)

Set the correct variables in `nlx.py` and run the code snippet below.

```
pipenv run nlx.py
```

# Troubleshooting

Some organizations may have trouble opening the csv files produced.

In that case you can try ASCII encoding the file and setting the row delimieter to CRLF with the following commands.

```bash
cat 2018.csv | iconv -c -t ASCII//IGNORE > 2018_ascii_dos.csv
unix2dos 2018_ascii_dos.csv
```
